In order for the Jetson TX2 unit to work properly with the LI-TX1-CB and the IMX477 camera, the process given in https://www.dropbox.com/s/m0p3p5y70d7nmj0/IMX477-MIPI_R32.2.1_TX2_Tri-CB_20190905_Driver_Guide.pdf?dl=0 has to be followed.

In order to skip later installations of additional packages it is recommended to install Jetpack 4.2.2 in the first step.

Install OpenCV 4 with CUDA support by running the following script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AastaNV/JEP/master/script/install_opencv4.1.1_Jetson.sh

Copy the script disabling group rt scheduling (make sure the script is executable): sudo cp JetsonCode/disable_group_rt_scheduling.sh /etc/rc.local
