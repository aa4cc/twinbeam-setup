In order for the Jetson TX2 unit to work properly with the LI-TX1-CB and the IMX477 camera, the process given in https://www.dropbox.com/s/5kthn4b6vfz1koa/IMX477_R28.2_TX2_CB_Tri_20180629.txt?dl=0 has to be followed.

In order to skip later installations of additional packages it is recommended to install Jetpack 3.2.1 in the first step.

Later, it is necessary to install the following packages for the accompanying software to work:

- CUDA 9.0 and CuFFT (included in Jetpack 3.2.1)
- LibArgus and EGLStream (included in Jetpack 3.2.1)
- OpenCV 2 (included in Jetpack 3.2.1)
- G++ (included in Jetpack 3.2.1)

In order to be able to Make further changes in the software, CMake 3.8.2 needs to be installed from source by following the process given in https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1048533/jetson-tx2/how-to-install-cmake-3-8-in-jetson-tx2-/post/5321379/#5321379
